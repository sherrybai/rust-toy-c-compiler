# Rust Toy C Compiler

Compiler for a tiny subset of C to AArch64 assembly, written in Rust. Roughly follows Nora Sandler's [Writing a C Compiler series](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html)

Done as part of my [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=927165f95f8df92d92538474364eacd7) W2'25 batch.
